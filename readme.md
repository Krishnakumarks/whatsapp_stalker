# Description
This is a chrome extension that just monitors certain profiles to know when they came online, using whatsapp web.

# Limitations
- As I have already mentioned, the extension uses whatsapp web, so it means if your phone is not able to reach the interface of whatsap web, it won't register.
- If a user is far below in the chat history, it might not be opened using the current method as whatsapp doesn't load all contacts at once.
- No notification system as of now.
- Selecting the users to stalk should be pretty and persistent.

# Installation
- Clone the git repository by using the **clone url** above.
- Go to chrome -> More Tools -> Extensions.
- Switch on developer mode by checking the box.
- Click on **Load Unpacked**
- Navigate to the folder you just cloned(_Steps until now won't be needed when the extension is released on the Chrome Store_).
- Go to web.whatsapp.com.
- Click on **Start Stalking** and input the users(coma separated, no spaces between users) exactly as they appear on the page(_WIP to make this step easy_).
- That's it, the extension will now record the history when those people come online.
- To see the history, simply click the extension icon.
