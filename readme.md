# Description
This is a chrome extension that just monitors certain profiles to know when they came online, using whatsapp web.

# Limitations
- As I have already mentioned, the extension uses whatsapp web, so it means if your phone is not able to reach the interface of whatsap web, it won't register.
- If a user is far below in the chat history, it might not be opened using the current method as whatsapp doesn't load all contacts at once.
- Currently only 1 profile can be monitored.
- No notification system as of now.
- Instead of just logging whenever the user is online, we should store the on and off times in localhost.
